Sure, I'll provide a basic example of a web application using Flask where users can upload documents and download them under a faculty section. For simplicity, I'll include a basic frontend using HTML for file upload and download functionality.

Here's the code:

```python
# app.py

from flask import Flask, render_template, request, send_from_directory
import os

app = Flask(__name__)

# Folder to store uploaded documents
UPLOAD_FOLDER = 'uploads'
app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER'] = UPLOAD_FOLDER

# Home page
@app.route('/')
def index():
    return render_template('index.html')

# Upload document
@app.route('/upload', methods=['POST'])
def upload_file():
    if request.method == 'POST':
        file = request.files['file']
        if file:
            filename = file.filename
            file.save(os.path.join(app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER'], filename))
            return 'File uploaded successfully'

# Download document
@app.route('/faculty/<filename>', methods=['GET'])
def download_file(filename):
    return send_from_directory(app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER'], filename, as_attachment=True)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

Now, let's create HTML templates for the frontend:

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document Upload</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Upload Document</h1>
    <form action="/upload" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
        <input type="file" name="file" accept=".pdf,.doc,.docx">
        <button type="submit">Upload</button>
    </form>
</body>
</html>
```

```html
<!-- faculty.html -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Faculty Section</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Faculty Section</h1>
    <ul>
        {% for file in files %}
        <li><a href="/faculty/{{ file }}">{{ file }}</a></li>
        {% endfor %}
    </ul>
</body>
</html>
```

Ensure you create a folder named `uploads` in the project directory to store uploaded documents.

This application provides a simple frontend where users can upload documents on the home page (`index.html`). Uploaded documents are stored in the `uploads` folder. The faculty can access the documents from the faculty section (`/faculty`) and download them.

To run the application, save the code in a file named `app.py` and execute it using a Python interpreter. Then access the application in a web browser.
